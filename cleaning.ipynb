    "2. We can see that Life Expectancy was fairly flat for all continents until 1870 (corresponding with Louis Pasteurs development of Germ Theory) where Europe, Oceania and the Americas begin their upward trend. However, for Asia and Africa, it is not until at least 1913 and 1925 respectively until they begin to rise. It should be noted that these figures are estimated, as data for Asia and Africa is very sparse until 1950, so it is difficult to find the exact point of change. \n",
